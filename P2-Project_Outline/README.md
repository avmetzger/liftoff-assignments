## Submission Instructions

### Overview
	In this project I would like to create a web application for people who collect things to be able to catalogue their collections and find other users who are willing to trade. For the simplicity of this capstone project, I am going to be focusing on smaller, easily tradable, digital collections, such as fossils in the new video game Animal Crossing: New Horizons from Nintendo. Ideally, if I have enough time, I can extend the libraries of collectibles to other popular collectibles such as trading cards, antiques, etc.
	The idea here came from the need to have an organized way to easily trade some items in Animal Crossing. The goal of collecting all the fossils takes awhile if the player doesn't work together with other people. There's also not a very easy way to catalogue what they have and what they need. This web application will allow users to document what they have collected so far, input what duplicates they have, view what they still need to find, and compare that to other users. If they have a duplicate that someone else needs and vice versa, the web app may be able to give them both the information they need to make a trade.

### Features
User Login: User accounts and profile pages
Collections page: Users can view and edit their collections
Trade feature: Users can offer to trade, and other users can see if they have overlapping duplicate items to trade

### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Hibernate
Thymeleaf templates

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll need to learn how to organize a trade between two users, showing people offering trades in real time, and limiting it to one on one trading.
